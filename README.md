### Hi ! ðŸ‘‹,I am Mridul(Euxodous)

This is not a decent README.md file...but it will be, soon enough!

For now:

Visit my repositories and contribute!
Take your vitamins and keep swimming!
Stay away from NSFW stuff and from everything that isn't healthy XD
Comment your code - it makes a lot easier for people to understand what you've done wrong hahaha
I LOVE YOU ALL! LOVE IS ALL WE NEED
(and also pizza's...)
